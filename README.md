# Dungeon Study in Unity

The main idea of the project is to develop a **dungeon** using Unity, where the rooms are procedurally generated. 
We are using a **Node Graph** integrated with a custom **Editor** and a node **overview** for management. The goal is to keep the room generation **randomized**, yet **well-structured**, ensuring a unique experience for the player.
